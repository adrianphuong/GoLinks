# GoLinks HackDay 2024 Project

## Overview

I worked on a web application using the following technologies:

- Frontend: React.js and TailwindCSS
- Backend: Express.js and Node.js

## Accomplishments

During the project, I achieved the following:

- Successfully fetched user data and fork count from the GitHub API.
- Avoided rate limiting within the API by storing user data into localStorage.
- Stored the GitHub Token in an environment variable for security.

## Challenges and Improvements

While working on the project, I encountered some challenges and areas for improvement:

- Changing user display amount: I modified the query parameters to the maximum limit of 100.
- Counting fork count correctly: I faced challenges in accurately counting fork counts and will work on improving this functionality.
- Ensuring user.login contains the content the user searched for.
- Properly counting fork count with the new results.
- Sorting languages in descending order.

## Reflections

Participating in this HackDay was an incredible learning experience and challenge. I gained valuable insights and skills throughout the process, and I'm grateful for the opportunity. Thank you, GoLinks!
